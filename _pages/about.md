The central theme of my research is geophysical fluid dynamics, with a focus on ocean dynamics and the oceanâ€™s role in global climate. 

I completed my PhD at the [School of Earth and Ocean Science, University of Victoria, BC, Canada](https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/index.php) in 2009. My PhD focussed on numerical modelling of the ocean's overturning circulation at mesoscale resolutions. 

In 2009, I began working at the [Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia](https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) as a post-doctoral researcher. In 2015, I received an Australian Research Council Discovering Early Career Researchers award to study Antarctic Bottom Water dynamics. I was promoted to Senior Lecturer at UNSW in 2016. 

In 2019, I received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship award to study the Antarctic Slope Current at the University of Sydney. In 2020, I started working at the [School of Geosciences, University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-geosciences.html).
