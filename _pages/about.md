The central theme of my research is geophysical fluid dynamics, with a focus on ocean dynamics and the oceanâ€™s role in global climate. I completed my PhD in ocean climate modelling at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada in 2009. From 2009 to 2019, I worked at the Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia. I am now at the School of Geosciences, University of Sydney. In 2015, I received an Australian Research Council Discovering Early Career Researchers award. In 2019, I received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship award.

	This is a test 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

#1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
